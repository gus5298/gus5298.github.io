Hi! I am a researcher currently pursuing a PhD at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, supervised by Prof. Veit Hagenmeyer. Before joining KIT, I was a research intern at the IMDEA Software Institute in Spain. I received a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering from Sheffield Hallam University (UK), and in 2021 completed a Master’s in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence at The University of Sheffield (UK). My research interest lies in the area of offensive security, with a focus on AI methods and within the context of critical infrastructure.

======

* I have been selected to be part of the [USENIX Security 2025 Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-artifacts)
* Our paper **Web Application Penetration Testing with Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review** is accepted by The 22nd International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA 2024). We highlight advancements and challenges in employing learning-based methods to enhance penetration testing, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions in the field. (Sept. 2024)
* I will serve as a TPC member for the [7th Annual Workshop on Cyber Threat Intelligence and Hunting](https://cyberhunt2024.cyberhunt.no/) (co-located with IEEE BigData 2024) and the [2nd Workshop on Recent Advances in Resilient and Trustworthy Machine Learning](https://artman-workshop.gitlab.io/) (co-located with ACSAC 2024) (Sept. 2024)
* Our paper **Attacking Learning-based Models in Smart Grids: Current Challenges and New Frontiers** is accepted by EnergySP 2024 (co-located with ACM e-Energy 2024). We identify unexplored areas and potential improvements in current methodologies by categorizing attacks, and assessing their ability to be reproduced. Additionally, we propose the integration of explainable artificial intelligence techniques into adversarial models. (Apr. 2024)
