Hi! I am a researcher currently pursuing a PhD at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/2154_4832.php) in Germany, supervised by [Prof. Veit Hagenmeyer](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/921_1213.php). Before joining KIT, I was a research intern at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/people/gustavo.sanchez/) in Spain. I received a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering from Sheffield Hallam University (UK), and in 2021 completed a Master’s in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence at The University of Sheffield (UK). My research interest lies in the area of offensive security, with a focus on AI methods and within the context of critical infrastructure.

News
======
* Our paper **Route Choice Prediction Through User Behavior Analysis: Towards Robustness Assessment Under External Perturbations** is accepted by IEEE Workshop on Security and Resiliency of Critical Infrastructure and Space Technologies (IEEE SR-CIST 2025), co-located with IEEE TPS. We present a preliminary study of route choice prediction and its robustness to small, realistic perturbations, with emphasis on attack surfaces that matter for transport and energy infrastructure. This is a collaboration with Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation GmbH. (Oct. 2025) 🆕

* Our work **Towards Intelligent Assurance for Autonomous AI Pentesters: Concurrent Compliance Auditing and
Self-Augmentation via Execution Trace Analysis** is accepted by ACM CCS 2025 Poster session. We propose embedding governance directly in the pentesting loop to preempt unsafe actions and support continuous self-improvement, laying the groundwork for fully autonomous yet accountable security assessments. (Aug. 2025) 

* Our paper **Explainable AI in Data Poisoning Threat Models Across the CIA Triad: A Smart Grid Case Study**  is accepted by IEEE TPS 2025. Our evaluation shows that in simple, single-shot poisoning the XAI-driven approach yields only marginal benefit over the random approach if the goal is indiscriminate poisoning, but it is very successful for targeted attacks. (Aug. 2025) 
* Our paper **A Global Analysis of Cyber Threats to the Energy Sector** will appear in the next issue of ATP Magazin (9/2025). This paper explores the intersection of geopolitical dynamics, cyber threat intelligence analysis, and advanced detection
technologies, with a focus on the energy domain. (Aug. 2025) 
* I was a visiting scholar at University of Massachusetts Lowell (USA), invited by [Prof. Yiming Chen](https://ianchen88.github.io/), and supported by a scholarship from the German Ministry of Science, Research and Arts. (June 2025) 
* Our papers **Insights and Lessons Learned from a Realistic Smart Grid Testbed for Cybersecurity Research** and **Attacks on the Siemens S7 Protocol Using an Industrial Control System Testbed** are accepted by EnergySP 2025 (co-located with ACM e-Energy 2025), and our work **Masquerading IEC 61850 GOOSE Protocol: Cyber‐Physical Experiments and Detection** is acepted as a poster in the main conference. (May 2025) 
* I will serve as a TPC member for the [International Workshop on Secure, Trustworthy, and Robust AI (STRAI)](https://2025.ares-conference.eu/program/strai/) (co-located with ARES 2025). (Apr. 2025) 
* I have been selected to be part of the [USENIX Security 2025 Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-artifacts). (Nov. 2024) 
* Our paper **Web Application Penetration Testing with Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review** is accepted by The 22nd International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA 2024). We highlight advancements and challenges in employing learning-based methods to enhance penetration testing, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions in the field. (Sept. 2024)
* I will serve as a TPC member for the [7th Annual Workshop on Cyber Threat Intelligence and Hunting](https://cyberhunt2024.cyberhunt.no/) (co-located with IEEE BigData 2024) and the [2nd Workshop on Recent Advances in Resilient and Trustworthy Machine Learning](https://artman-workshop.gitlab.io/) (co-located with ACSAC 2024) (Sept. 2024)
* Our paper **Attacking Learning-based Models in Smart Grids: Current Challenges and New Frontiers** is accepted by EnergySP 2024 (co-located with ACM e-Energy 2024). We identify unexplored areas and potential improvements in current methodologies by categorizing attacks, and assessing their ability to be reproduced. Additionally, we propose the integration of explainable artificial intelligence techniques into adversarial models. (Apr. 2024)
